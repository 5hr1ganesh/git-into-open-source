## Contributing

Submitting contributions to any repository is easy!

The first step is to check out the projects contributing guidelines ([here's ours](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)). These will usually outline setup instructions, and give you pointers as to where and how you can contribute.

Next you'll need to either fork and clone the repo, or if it's a small change you can just edit it via the GitHub UI. [Here is a step-by-step guide](/guides/submit-your-first-pr-cli.md) to help you get started with that.

Finally, you can submit the pull request! Head back to the source repo, and you should see a new button, saying "Create Pull Request". If the author has set a PR template, be sure it's filled in properly.
